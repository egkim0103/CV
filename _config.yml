about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in IT Management (Management Information Systems) at the College of Business, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
  My research explores how consumers interact with information using observational data to provide actionable insights for sustainable operation of online platforms and more diversity of public institutions. I am particularly interested in economic and behavioral mechanisms around political information such as  consumers’ willingness to pay for news media.

  Research Interests
    - Economics of Information Systems 
    - Behavioral IS 
    - Digital News Consumption 
    - Media and Entertainments 
    - Various Type of Polarization

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
